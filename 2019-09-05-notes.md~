##Logistics
- 14 total physical sessions
 + In two weeks, we won't be meeting in person
 + Likewise over thanksgiving
Even though they won't be physically meeting, we'll still be expected to
finish and turn in work in a timely manner.

#Server Primer
Data is carried over ethernet cables, which are made of copper. Ethernet
cables have certain kinds of coating, and most are coated in some
variety of PVC. Plenum rated cables are coated in a material which makes
their burning vapors non-mind-shatteringly-toxic. Plenum rated cable is
required for plenum cold-air return ventilation systems.

VoIP: Voice over IP. Telephone service provided over ethernet, rather
than RJ-11 phone cord.

Copper cables have attenuation over distance, and are rated for a
certain throughput over distance. This is theoretically about 100 yards,
but in practical cases usually comes out to a run of 90, with a bit of
slack. For this reason, we split up our network equipment
into different racks/frames.

MDF: Main Distribution Frame
IDF: Intermediate Distribution Frame

All data and similar needs, such as electrical grounding and bonding,
run from the MDF to the IDFs. Because of both the data attenuation,
throughput, etc, data is carried from an MDF to the IDFs using
fiber-optic cable.

Fiber-optic cable comes in two varieties: Single-mode fiber and
Multi-mode fiber. The advice is to run single-mode fiber, because it is
better to run the same kind of equipment, and because multi-mode fiber
runs into similar problems with attenuation that copper does.

Grounding and bonding is done through low-resistance cables which run
from grounding bars for each frame to the MDF, which itself has a master
grounding bar, which runs to an "earth" outside the building, which is
at least 10 feet deep into the terrain.

AC: Air Conditioning

Air conditioning is required to keep equipment running at a reasonable
temperature. A good temperature is somewhere between 68-70 degrees F.
Humidity is also a concern: too much, and your equipment will rust; too
little, and it will easily build static charge. Maximum Wattage as
summed across all equipment is run through for the BTUs. Thermal output
and management is usually measured in BTUs, which is British Thermal
Units, sometimes measured in tons. You'll want also to account for a
number of people in the room.  Every frame should be cooled by at least
two AC units which could each handle the full BTU load of the frame, and
both these should be running in concert. When one of these AC units goes
down, the remaining units should be able to carry the whole load and
pick up the slack.

UPS: Uninterruptible Power Supply
A UPS is an Uninterruptible Power Supply, which takes AC power from the
power provider, with all its browns and spikes, capacitates it, and
provides clean, regular power to the equipment. This of course requires
an estimation of wattage and amp-hours. Among the considerations
required are the amperage and outlets. Blowing out the wall circuitry
with an industrial UPS is a bad time. Industrial power plugs are also
not compatible with standard US power outlets.

Monolithic servers: a single-vendor unit machine which has all
components of CPU, RAM, Storage, and OS.

Virtual machines/hypervisor: OSs running on virtual hardware which is
managed by a hypervisor or VMware host. Usually literally runs on top of
unix.

Flexpod: a unit which carried, of variable vendors, Server, Storage, and
Virtual Machines. Needs also switching equipment which keeps all
components networked. A problem arises because each individual component
needs firmware and OS upgrades, and this is time and order of operation
sensitive. When looking for a flexpod, it will take the form of several
different pieces of hardware, between potentially, but not necessarily,
different vendors. More of a concept, a design, than a particular
product.

Hyperflex: Single-vendor solution for all the same needs. That comes
out to a particular product or solution available from one vendor. The
idea is that you have three redundant machines which operate in a
similar model to RAID, operating out of one frame.

Stretchcluster: More than one hyperflex frame running in concert, which
are monitored by a Witness.

SAN: Storage Area Network presents "LUNs", which are block storage that's
available for servers. See wikipedia -> Logical Unit Number

NAS: Network Attached Storage. Presents file-based storage for
workstations via an IP attached special-purpose linux machine.
