Project2a and project2b both achieve the same thing, but in different ways. After going back through and looking at it, I realized that, while the first way I did it was perfectly valid, and this is theoretically a script, that would be a lot of extra typing for a user to do, all those sandbox calls. Also, potentially error prone, if the user isn't careful about their working directory. Hence, version b, which should be a less error prone workflow, and execute the same things with fewer keystrokes. Version a is as an executable script. Version b is the order of operations I would take as a user doing this manually.
