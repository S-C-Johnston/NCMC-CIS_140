Unicode keys in Windows:
	Holt ALT key and type in numbers corrosponding to character.
	Meta+r charmap will open a character map GUI.

**Hardware**
-	Motherboard
	+	North Bridge
		*	Relays information between CPU and main systems/memory.
	+	South Bridge
		*	Controls peripheral devices.
-	Transistors
-	CPU: Central Processing Unit
	+	CU: Control Unit
	+	ALU: Arithmetic Logic Unit
	+	Cache
		*	Data Processing Cycle
			When the CPU caches run out of space, they push storage to memory. When memory runs out, some information is stored on the hard drive temporarily in SWAP.
-	RAM: Random Access Memory
	+	Volatile Flash Memory
		*	When it loses power, it loses all stored information.
-	Hard Drive
	+	HDD: Hard Disk Drive
		*	Latency measured in Milliseconds
	+	SSH: Solid State Drive
		*	Non-volatile flash storage
-	PSU: Power Supply Unit
	+	Continuous vs burst wattage
		Continuous wattage for long term sustainable performance, vs burst wattage for POST and boot.
	(Best manufacturers are PC Power & Cooling, and Antec)

**AAA**
-	Authenticate
	+	Identifying a user.
	+	Username, password.
-	Access
	+	What a user can do.
-	Auditing
	+	What and how you audit.
	+	Who did what, where, how.

**Operating Systems**
-	Kernel
	+	Talks directly to the hardware in kernel space, to make it accessible to the rest of the environment, shell, users, etc.
	+	Handles hardware and data processing cycle natively.
	+	Device drivers extend capability of kernel to talk to specialized hardware.
-	Linux
	+	Free and Open Source
	+	Better if known from the shell.
	+	Not necessarily the best for non-technically inclined folk.
	+	Multi-tasking, multi-threaded, multi-user (timesharing) OS.
	+	Once upon a time, used with terminals logging into the system on the network. No longer common-use. Typically users will have their own machines.
-	UNIX
-	Virtual Machines
	+	VMWare
	+	SAN: Storage Area Network
		*	Network Switches made redundant with multiple control units.
		*	If one goes down, the other picks up the load.
		*	Redunant switches connected to chassis loaded with storage.
	+	Server Array
	+	Redundancy
	+	HyperVisor
		*	Networked locally and interfaced with from some connection over a browser.

**Remote Access**
-	Ports
	+	80:	Web
	+	434:	Secure Web
-	TelNet
	+	Plaintext connection.
-	SSH
	+	Encrypted connection.
		*	PGP
		*	GPG
		*	Deffy-Helman?
			No longer supported. As of Chrome 45, no longer supported by that browser.

**Command syntax**
1	Command
	-	Non-optional
	-	Only non-optional part of a command.
2	-options
	-	Indicated by flags (-)
	-	Mutate the command do perform different variations of the operation.
3	arguments
	-	Pathnames to file, for example.

**Commands**
-	Navigation/information
	+	ls	List	Lists
		*	files in directory specified (cwd if no arguments)
		*	-a	All files
		*	-l	Long form
	+	pwd	Print Working Directory
	+	cd	Change Directory
-	File handling
	+	touch	Creates an empty file with name of argument, or updates modification timestamp.
	+	chmod	Change mode/permissions
		*	Can be set in octal mode
			(4) read
			(2) write
			(1) execute
			(0) none
			Numbers are added for permissions on file. 4+2 is read/write. 7 is rwx
	+	chown	Change owner of file.
	+	chgrp	Change group for file.
-	User info
	+	w	Show who is logged in and what they're doing.
	+	who	Show who is logged in.
	+	finger	Show user info?
	+	last	Show the login log, last listed most recently.

**Compound commands / redirection**
-	|	Pipe shell builtin (meta-character)
	+	Redirects output from command to the left as input to command to the right.
	+	command:stdout | command:stdin
-	>	Write to file.
	+	Will overwrite any information in a file for the new input.
-	>>	Append to file.
	+	Will add any input to the end of the file.
-	;	endline
	+	When used to separate commands, multiple commands can be written on one line, in order of writing(?).

**Wildcards**
Standins for explicit characters to return results based on wildcard type.
-	?	One character
-	*	Any number of characters

**File structure**
-	Partitions
	+	Most modern filesystems can handle up to 4 such partitions.
	+	Partitions are arbitrary logical organization of data. Operations on one partition do not affect data on another unless explicitly stated.
-	Pathnames
	+	Absolute pathnames start with the root directory "/"
	+	Relative pathnames can have no prefix (for a directory in the current working directory), or "./" (current directory) or "../" (directory one level above current)
-	Directories
	+	An analogue to folders, in the file cabinet metaphor.
	+	Can contain directories or files.
	+	Everything is a file, directories are just a special kind of file that point to information.
-	Root directory
	+	Top-most directory on a partition. All other storage of a partition eventually goes back to root.
	+	/
-	"Root" directory
	+	Home directory of the root user.
	+	/root/
-	etc
	+	Contains directories and files for the configuration and operation of the OS.
	+	/etc/drivers/someDrivers
