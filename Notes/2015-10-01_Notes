**Disaster Recovery**
History: Server with HDDs, OS installed on that server. Suggested with 2 partitions: system and data.
Current: Storage Area Network partitioned as needed. Sections for servers, section for Networked File System share.

By carving the partitions up and presenting them to the VMs and backup software the right way, can be set up for "Brick Level" restores. LUNs are virtual hard drives to which one can point an application for storage.
