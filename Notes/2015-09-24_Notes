**Disaster Recovery**
+	Network -> data -> Backup Software -> Drive Array -> Tape storage

		Everything dictated to back up all at once.
	*	Incremental
		Full backup day 1, only backs up things changed from last backup. Full backup again on schedule.
		Takes up to 7 tapes in a week.
	*	Differential
		Full backup day 1, backs up things chaned since last full backukp. Full backup again on schedule.
		Needs only 2 tapes in a week.
+	Cloud backups
	*	Handled off-site, primary concern is speed of transmission.
+	3rd party company choice must be a careful one.
